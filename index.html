      <p class="intro-text">
        At Navpankh Welfare Society, we believe that every individual deserves the opportunity to rise, thrive, and live with dignity. Guided by compassion and driven by purpose, we work at the grassroots level to support education, health, and social well-being for those who need it most.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        Navpankh was founded on a simple yet powerful belief — when people are supported with care, guidance, and opportunity, they grow stronger and more self-reliant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our initiatives focus on nurturing potential, restoring hope, and creating sustainable change within communities.
      </p>

      <h2>What We Stand For</h2>
      <ul class="values-list">
        <li><strong>Education as Empowerment</strong> – Helping children and youth unlock their potential through learning and skill development</li>
        <li><strong>Care with Dignity</strong> – Supporting health, nutrition, and well-being with empathy and respect</li>
        <li><strong>Community First</strong> – Working alongside communities to create lasting, positive impact</li>
        <li><strong>Hope in Action</strong> – Turning compassion into meaningful action</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why "Navpankh"</h2>
      <p>
        "Navpankh" means new wings — a symbol of hope, protection, and new beginnings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just as wings help one rise above challenges, our work aims to give individuals the strength and support they need to move forward with confidence.
      </p>
